# CSS Reset

This CSS file aims to remove all built-in browser styling. Standard elements like H1-6, p, strong, em, margin, etcetera end up looking exactly alike, having NO decoration at all. 
Heading tags are already responsive.

- HTML font-size: 62.5%
- Body font-size: 1.8rem

This means, 1rem = 10px.
